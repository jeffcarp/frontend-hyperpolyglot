### New frameworks

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/jeffcarp/frontend-hyperpolyglot/issues/new) proposing a new framework before submitting a PR. Currently the page is getting a bit wide, but new frameworks (with relatively wide usage) are always welcome. There might come a point soon when we have to re-think the layout to accommodate more frameworks.

### Local development

This is a Jekyll app, so first [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then, just run `jekyll serve --watch` and go to `localhost:4000`! :smile:
